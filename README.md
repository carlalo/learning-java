# Learning Java
Me learning Java.

I like computers. Actually I like to play with computers. I probably want to do stuff with computers in the future. I have done Minecraft. I experimented with Scratch. Now I want to program them the hard way.

Why Java? I have no clue. I can ask guys. That will help me.

I will start with easy experiments and see how to go on from there.
